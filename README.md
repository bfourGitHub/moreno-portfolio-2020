Bryan Moreno 2020 UW Bootcamp Portfolio

This portfolio application will serve as a beginning template for showcasing projects that I will complete in UW Coding Bootcamp.

All Parts of this application are meant to be updated as content and work become available.

Photos and project names can be easily updated and later linked to deployed versions of specific projects.

Links in the nav bar link to corresponding sections of the appications.

This application uses flex-box to easily allow for easier viewing on a range of devices.

Styling to page will be continuously updated to fit completed projects.
